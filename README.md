# Fuzzy Signature Approach for Emotion Classification Enhancement 
In this study, we introduced a novel fuzzy signature-based approach to classi-fy emotions; illustrated on love as a complex emotion (derived from the combi-nation of six key sub-emotions: serenity, joy, ecstasy, acceptance, trust, and ad-miration). Using fuzzy signature, we captured the overlapping nature of these emotions in textual data, allowing smooth transitions between different levels of emotional intensity. Then we extended the model using Mamdani inference sys-tem and aggregated different tree structures (observations) where each instance modeled emotions (love emotion in particular) slightly different on the emotions spectrum. Finally, the model was utilized to generate a labeled dataset, then test-ed on Recurrent Neural Networks model for emotion detection and proven its efficiency. Fuzzy Signature Emotion Classification (FSEC) is useful in capturing the inherent ambiguity and variability in emotional states and improves the accu-racy of emotion labeling (which can be utilized in numerous application areas). We are eager to expand this model for future applications in sentiment analysis and psychological studies where accurately understanding emotional states is vital.

## Problem Formulation
Humans express their emotions by words. Emotion analysis is a method to identify emotional status. Emotion Distribution Learning (EDL) translates human emotions by considering multiple intensities conveyed in data format. Generally, emotion detection is more complex than just labeling it under six categories: love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and anger. Indeed, capturing the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of human emotions is a complex task as presented in Plutchik wheel of emotions. In this paper we propose a novel emotion classification (analysis) framework; the Fuzzy Signature Emotion Classification (FSEC) model. FSEC facilitates Fuzzy Signature (FSig) to dy-namically conduct structural trees depending on the Plutchik wheel of emo-tions, integrated with the classical EDL approach to enhance emotion classi-fication classical methods  (to some extent). We applied for FSEC on a Re-current Neural Networks (RNN) emotion labeling model and compared it with the state-of-the-art. The results show more efficient detection of the overlapping embedded emotion cues in the dataset (tweets dataset) with high accuracy and F1 score (source code)
