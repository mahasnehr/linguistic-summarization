# Emotion Label Enhancement with Fuzzy Signature Inference System
In this work we propose a data-driven approach based on NN, without relying heavily on human help. We will develop a general framework for single-document summarization. We will train the models on large scale corpora containing thousands of document-summary pairs.

## Problem Formulation
Humans express their emotions by words. Emotion analysis is a method to identify emotional status. Emotion Distribution Learning (EDL) translates human emotions by considering multiple intensities conveyed in data. Gen-erally, emotion detection is more complex than just labeling it under six cate-gories: love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and anger. Indeed, capturing the in-herent uncertainty and vagueness of human emotions is a complex task as presented in Plutchik wheel of emotions. In this paper we propose a novel emotion classification (analysis) framework; the Fuzzy Signature Emotion Classification (FSEC) model. FSEC facilitates Fuzzy Signature (FSig) to dy-namically conduct structural trees depending on the Plutchik wheel of emo-tions, integrated with the classical EDL approach to enhance (to some extent) the classical emotion classification methods.
