# Fuzzy Signature Approach for Emotion Classification Enhancement 
In this work we propose a data-driven approach based on NN, without relying heavily on human help. We will develop a general framework for single-document summarization. We will train the models on large scale corpora containing thousands of document-summary pairs.

## Problem Formulation
Humans express their emotions by words. Emotion analysis is a method to identify emotional status. Emotion Distribution Learning (EDL) translates human emotions by considering multiple intensities conveyed in data format. Generally, emotion detection is more complex than just labeling it under six categories: love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and anger. Indeed, capturing the inherent uncertainty and vagueness of human emotions is a complex task as presented in Plutchik wheel of emotions. In this paper we propose a novel emotion classification (analysis) framework; the Fuzzy Signature Emotion Classification (FSEC) model. FSEC facilitates Fuzzy Signature (FSig) to dy-namically conduct structural trees depending on the Plutchik wheel of emo-tions, integrated with the classical EDL approach to enhance emotion classi-fication classical methods  (to some extent). We applied for FSEC on a Re-current Neural Networks (RNN) emotion labeling model and compared it with the state-of-the-art. The results show more efficient detection of the overlapping embedded emotion cues in the dataset (tweets dataset) with high accuracy and F1 score (source code)
